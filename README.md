# taskmaster-pro

Created a mobile-first application for client. Users are now able to add and edit tasks, which they can sort into lists. Tasks turn to red if they are overdue, or highlighted yellow if they are due within two days. Dates for tasks are set with a datepicker and saved to the DOM. Even if users leave their application open for days in the browser, the app is set to refresh automatically every thirty minutes, keeeping due dates refreshed and colors of due tasks relevant `taskAudit`.

Trash can / drag and drop features help make the UI/UX of the site easy and intuitive to use. Whether on mobile or desktop, the site is responsive and its customized settings carry over well.
